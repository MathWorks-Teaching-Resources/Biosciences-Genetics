This curriculum module teaches students the basic concepts involved in computational genetics.  

## Description

In this module, we will learn how to use MATLAB to analyze genetic data. We will calculate the statistics of a single DNA sequence, use real genetic data to create a phylogenetic tree, and explore within-species genetic variation. Make sure you're familiar with the basics of using MATLAB by going through the [MATLAB Onramp](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/details/matlab-onramp/gettingstarted) before continuing.

This module utilizes data pulled from [GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/), the NIH's library of publicly available genetic sequences.

## Prerequisites 

This module assumes basic MATLAB knowledge and it is recommended that all students take the [MATLAB Onramp](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/details/matlab-onramp/gettingstarted).

## Getting Started 

To learn more about opening and using MATLAB, see the accompanying [Getting Started](Getting_Started.pdf) guide. 

## Sections 
Notes: These scripts can all be run independently, though we recommend going through these live scripts in order. These live scripts are intended to be used with output inline. To change the output, go to the View tab of the toolstrip, and select ![](images/outputinline.png)  Output Inline. 
The scripts have areas for the students to interact with the code ![](images/try.png) . There will also be exercises ![](images/exercise.png)  in most scripts and the answers will be provided at the end.  A problem set for students to practice these concepts is also included here. Throughout the scripts, there are also moments to students to reflect on what they've learned or on what the data means ![](images/reflect.png) . Particularly interesting examples of how these concepts are used in "real-world" biology are also pointed out ![](images/app.png).
